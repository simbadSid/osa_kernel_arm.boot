It is the absolute minimum boot code for an ARM platform.


It compiles and runs on top of Qemu, but you need to setup a view path in the makefile to match your configuration.

The goal is to help get started off the ground with the minimal setting for bare-metal software on an ARM platform.

You are asked to do the following before the next lecture:
     - Start by looking at the README.
     - Understanding the makefile and how the code is compile and linked into an ELF (test.elf).
     - You must also understand the use of objcopy and the generation of a binary (test.bin)
     - You must understand in particular the linker script (ldscript).
     - Look at the code and understand it.

       In particular, understand the polling nature of the code and how the UART is manipulated.

       Understand the hardware registers, you are given the PL011 manual (attached).


     - Compile and single-step through the code, using gdb (command line)

       Understand how this is done, until you can actually start Qemu and gdb manually, on your own...


     - Test using Qemu via a serial line above a telnet, as it is shown 
in the Makefile.


You have a first set of documents to help you.

     - A tutorial on GDB

     - A README on Qemu and GDB.

     - The PL011 specification document.


Have fun.
