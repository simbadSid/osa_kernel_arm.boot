We will have time Tuesday to discuss the code.


     - You need to understand the Makefile and the tools used 
(gcc/ld/as/objcopy)

     - Read about the ELF format and play with objdump on the produce 
test.elf.

       -> check that the code is layed out as the linker script says it is.

     - Read about linker scripts

       Play around with it.

     - Learn about gdb and C debugging if you are not fluent.

       Learn about the GDB stub embedded in Qemu.

      Try out debugging from gdb in command line, from Eclipse, or using 
DDD.

      For DDD, if the fonts are ugly, you can change them in the DDD 
startup file.

    - Read/learn about the GIC/GID specification from ARM

      The Generic Interrupt Controller and the Generic Interrupt 
Distributor.
